## Oscillator
An Oscillator is a technical analysis tool. It helps determining whether a market is overbought or oversold. The oscillator values fluctuate within an upper and lower bound. When the oscillator values reach the upper/lower bound, that could be a hint that the market is overbought/undersold.
